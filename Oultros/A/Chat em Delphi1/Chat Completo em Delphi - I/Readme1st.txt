IMT Chatting Program

1 File Server.Ico
1 File Binus.jpg
1 File Readme1st.txt


This program along with its source code is a freeware, you may change or edit its contents or source code anyway you like, just honour my hardwork by keeping the credit text on the upper left of the source code intact.

The source code is somewhat messy(with a few unused Variables :), so if any of you have any question regarding the usage of a procedure or what's a certain variable for, or the logic of doing things, or anything, please don't be hesitated to mail me.  I'll be more than happy to explain it to you.

To run this program properly, you have to activate the server found on ...IMTChat/Server/Project1.exe first, and then you can activate the client.
